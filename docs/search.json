It will then introduce conservation-related applications of EMIT data, including habitat as well as plant trait and diversity mapping. Finally, the last presentation will explore a combined use of both EMIT and ECOSTRESS data for assessing pre-wildfire risk in Los Angeles, California. https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_P-WgfwuYQButrB-Cdjgm0Q#/registration\nJanuary, 2026 - SCGIS Vancouver Meeting\nWe are currently planning the first meeting for SCGIS Vancouver members. This will consist of a workshop followed by a more general meeting of thechapter.\nIn this first workshop we will generate and gather spatial layers from local open data portals and set them up into a cloud ready map database powered by open source QGIS and QField[Cloud] in a conservation setting, with a case study in a local Vancouver park!\nThese maps can be synced between field users on mobile (collecting the data) and desktop to provide real time updates on both ends.\nExact date and details to follow!\n\nJuly 7-10, 2026 – SCGIS Annual Conference\nEstes Park Center, Rocky Mountain National Park, CO, USA\n\nStay tuned for more information!\nhttps://www.scgis.org/conference"

His research explores the use of multi-source remote sensing and geospatial datasets towards enhanced monitoring of the carbon cycle across boreal landscapes. During his time at UBC, Ramon has been involved in supporting a wide variety of undergraduate and graduate GIS courses, course development initiatives, and serves as a Teaching Assistant (TA) Training Coordinator for the Faculty of Forestry. As part of SCGIS Vancouver, he provides technical expertise on satellite remote sensing and looks forward to supporting local GIS practitioners in growing their skillset, highlighting their work, and connecting with their community.\n\n\n\nSadie is a PhD student in UBC Forestry, where her graduate work has focused on applying remote sensing to disturbance ecology across British Columbia. Her current research investigates how drone-based lidar can support operational pyro-silviculture prescriptions to reduce wildfire risk. Sadie is deeply engaged in scientific education and communication, having developed climate change education materials for students from primary school through university. Through SCGIS, Sadie hopes to build community and uplift early-career scientists and conservationists.\n\n\n\nLiam is a PhD Candidate at UBC Forestry working in remote sensing. His research focuses on integrating lidar (from drones and aircraft) into silvicultural practices. He is also involved in local conservation efforts at several regional parks including aiding in their integration of GIS into ecosystem restoration. As part of SCGIS Vancouver Liam hopes to bring technical and regional knowledge to help build the capacity of the GIS conservation community around Vancouver and beyond.\n\n\n\n\nAdvisory members support the Chapter with their technical support and great ideas!\n\n\n\nFor 20+ years, Trevor has been combining geospatial and field data to produce maps, understand change, make predictions, and assist decision makers across a variety of forested landscapes. Trevor’s work as a scientist, educator, program developer, and team builder involves communities, conservation non-profits, Universities, governments, and private sector organizations, and includes 20 countries across five continents. Trevor is Adjunct Faculty at UBC, a co-founder and the Global Technical Lead for Tayo Climate Partners, and the Blue Forests and Geospatial advisor for Blue Ventures Conservation."
