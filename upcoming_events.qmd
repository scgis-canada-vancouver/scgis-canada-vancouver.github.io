## Upcoming Events {#upcoming-events}
    
-   **December 2, 2025** - Free SCGIS Webinar:\
    Advancing Conservation and Community Resilience with Thermal and Hyperspectral Remote Sensing:     Applications from NASA’s ECOSTRESS and EMIT Missions\
    This upcoming webinar will first highlight the use of ECOSTRESS data for urban heat analysis and   mitigation. It will then introduce conservation-related applications of EMIT data, including habitat as well as plant trait and diversity mapping. Finally, the last presentation will explore a combined use of both EMIT and ECOSTRESS data for assessing pre-wildfire risk in Los Angeles, California.

-   **January, 2026** - SCGIS Vancouver Meeting\
    We are currently planning the first meeting for SCGIS Vancouver members. This will consist of a workshop followed by a more general meeting of thechapter.
    
    In this first workshop we will generate and gather spatial layers from local open data portals and set them up into a cloud ready map database powered by open source QGIS and QField[Cloud] in a conservation setting, with a case study in a local Vancouver park!

    These maps can be synced between field users on mobile (collecting the data) and desktop to provide real time updates on both ends.
    
    Exact date and details to follow!
