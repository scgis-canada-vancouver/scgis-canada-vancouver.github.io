-   **April, 2026** - SCGIS Vancouver Workshop\
    We are currently planning workshop hosted by SCGIS Vancouver. In this workshop we will generate and gather spatial layers from local open data portals and set them up into a cloud ready map database powered by open source QGIS and QField\[Cloud\] in a conservation setting, with a case study in a local Vancouver park!

    These maps can be synced between field users on mobile (collecting the data) and desktop to provide real time updates on both ends.

    Exact date and details to follow!
